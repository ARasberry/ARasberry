# Hello! My name is Austin Rasberry

I am a Computer Science student at the University of North Alabama.

I am interested in Full-Stack Engineering and creating user-focused programs.

I love music and playing guitar, as well as playing video games like Valorant, Destiny, and Pokemon. 

I love solving puzzles which is a huge reason I love to code and build programs!

I am currently deciding on a project to persue... but stay tuned as I have an interesting idea brewing!
